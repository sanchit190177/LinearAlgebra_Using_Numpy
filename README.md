# ðŸ“˜ Linear Algebra using NumPy

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to perform key **Linear Algebra** operations using the **NumPy** library in Python.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

The notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Dot Product and Matrix Multiplication**
2. **Determinant, Transpose, and Inverse of a Matrix**
3. **System of Linear Equations**  
   - Solving using matrix operations (`np.linalg.inv`, `@` operator)
4. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `jupyter`

Install them (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install numpy jupyter
